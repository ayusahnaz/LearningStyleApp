to lectures and read material written on chalkboards and in textbooks and handouts. Unfortunately, most people are visual learners, which means that most students do not get nearly
as much as they would if more visual presentation were used in class. Good learners are capable
of processing information presented either visually or verbally."

If you are a visual learner, try to find diagrams, sketches, schematics, photographs, flow
charts, or any other visual representation of course material that is predominantly verbal. Ask
your instructor, consult reference books, and see if any videotapes or CD-ROM displays of the
course material are available. Prepare a concept map by listing key points, enclosing them in
boxes or circles, and drawing lines with arrows between concepts to show connections. Colorcode
your notes with a highlighter so that everything relating to one topic is the same color."

Write summaries or outlines of course material in your own words. Working in groups
can be particularly effective: you gain understanding of material by hearing classmatesâ€™
explanations and you learn even more when you do the explaining."
