other may be strong, moderate, or mild. To be effective as a learner and problem solver, you
need to be able to function both ways. If you overemphasize intuition, you may miss important
details or make careless mistakes in calculations or hands-on work; if you overemphasize sensing,
you may rely too much on memorization and familiar methods and not concentrate enough on
understanding and innovative thinking."

Sensors remember and understand information best if they can see how it connects to the
real world. If you are in a class where most of the material is abstract and theoretical, you may
have difficulty. Ask your instructor for specific examples of concepts and procedures, and find
out how the concepts apply in practice. If the teacher does not provide enough specifics, try to
find some in your course text or other references or by brainstorming with friends or classmates."

Many college lecture classes are aimed at intuitors. However, if you are an intuitor and
you happen to be in a class that deals primarily with memorization and rote substitution in
formulas, you may have trouble with boredom. Ask your instructor for interpretations or theories
that link the facts, or try to find the connections yourself. You may also be prone to careless
mistakes on test because you are impatient with details and donâ€™t like repetition (as in checking
your completed solutions). Take time to read the entire question before you start answering and
be sure to check your results."
